# Tic-Tac-Toe & Matrix of Colors

## Description

The project consist of two phases:

The first phase is about building a custom hook that can keep track of state changes and use it to create a matrix of colored squares which can be individually selected by the user and the order in which the user picked the colors is remembered in order for the user to be able to go backwards and forwards in time with their selected colors.

The second phase is about building a tic-tac-toe board game which allows move travelling and replaying the game when a winner is determined.
